Metalbond is a tool suite that manages routes for virtual private networking in datacenters. An instance of metalbond receives route updates from its connected peer, and distributes these updates to other subscribed peers. In this way, local route changes happening on a hypervisor can propagate across a cluster and get processed on other hypervisors.
